# Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR)

## Purpose
The main purpose of AR and VR is to create immersive learning and working environments. AR overlays digital elements onto the real world (e.g., via AR headsets), while VR places users in fully virtual environments (e.g., via VR headsets). These technologies make learning and work more engaging, hands-on, and memorable.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  AR and VR are used to teach complex subjects more effectively. Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) uses Microsoft HoloLens with HoloAnatomy software to teach anatomy. Students learn anatomical structures faster and understand them more clearly than with cadaver dissection.

- **In IT**:  
  Companies like Accenture use VR in their enterprise metaverse to improve employee onboarding. Their virtual campus, called the "Nth Floor," has onboarded over 150,000 employees with an average feedback rating of 4.7/5 and 94% favorability.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  During COVID-19, CWRU shipped HoloLens devices to 185 students, allowing them to join virtual anatomy classes from home using mixed-reality and video conferencing. Students reported clearer understanding and faster learning than traditional methods.
